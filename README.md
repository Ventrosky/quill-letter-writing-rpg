## A letter-writing roleplaying game for terminals

>Digital adaptation of the game **Quill - A letter-writing roleplaying game for a single player**, designed by *Scott Malthouse* and published by *Trollish Delver Games*. Support the game author by purchasing the PDF rules from [DriveThruRPG.com](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/170400/Quill-A-LetterWriting-Roleplaying-Game-for-a-Single-Player)

It features all classes and scenarios from the base book and the Love Letters supplement.
