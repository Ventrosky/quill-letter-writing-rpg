# Quill - A letter-writing roleplaying game for terminals

>Digital adaptation of the game **Quill - A letter-writing roleplaying game for a single player**, designed by *Scott Malthouse* and published by *Trollish Delver Games*. Support the game author by purchasing the PDF rules from DriveThruRPG.com

It features all classes and scenarios from the base book.
I have included proofread and spellcheck functionalities by using the *nodehun* and *write-good* node packages.
